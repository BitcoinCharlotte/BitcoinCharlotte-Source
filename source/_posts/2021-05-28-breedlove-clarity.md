Hello Bitcoiners! We will be hosting a new series of Bitcoin Charlotte events in addition to the socials throughout the remainder of the year. These events will mainly be in the form of presentations, speakers, and panels with the goal to help more people than we can through the socials.

**The first one, "Bitcoiners in Paradise!" is June 16th, 6pm at Jackelope Jacks. [RSVP HERE](https://www.meetup.com/BitcoinCharlotte/events/278453435/)!**

This one is excellent! Great questions capturing current concerns and Breedlove's clarity in answers are spectacular.
