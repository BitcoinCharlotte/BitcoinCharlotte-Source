Michael Saylor is making huge waves in the bitcoin space. In August and September of 2020 he converted his company, MicroStrategy, reserves into bitcoin holdings totaling over 70,000 BTC! Last week he hosted a [Bitcoin Summit](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit) where corporations came to learn more about bitcoin. Michael Saylor is one of the first investors at this scale, but how did he do this? With the help of Ross Stevens, founder and chairman of NYDIG. Get ready to have your mind blown by this hugely insightful video. [Video also on YouTube here](https://youtu.be/wA_fI-wUqnw).
