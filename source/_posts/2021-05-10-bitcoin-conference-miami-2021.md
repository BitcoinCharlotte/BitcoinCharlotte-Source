The bitcoin event of the year is upon us - [Bitcoin Converence Miami 2021](https://b.tc/conference)! Many members from the Bitcoin Charlotte meetup and Raleigh meetup are converging with thousands of others around the world. It's just three weeks away! Miami mayor is friendly to bitcoin, covid restrictions have been suspended in florida, and the excitement on [bitcoin twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitcoin) is peaking! The event tickets are very pricey now, but there are a host of [satelite events]() surrounding the event as well to participate in. Come join us in Miami!
