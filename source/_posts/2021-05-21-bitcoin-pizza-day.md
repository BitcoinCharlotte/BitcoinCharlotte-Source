Bitcoin Pizza Day is here! Eleven years ago Laszlo Hanyecz paid Jeremy ‚ÄúJercos‚Äù Sturdivant 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. That's about $400 million at todays prices! Click on the link to learn more about the transaction and the state of bitcoin ecosystem more than a decade ago. In honor of the famous bitcoin purchase we will be providing pizza tomorrow at Saturday Sats @ Salty Parrot Brewing!

<small> This song represents the true spirit of bitcoin! Dollar signs distract and wont bring you happiness. They bring you more choices. It‚Äôs not about being rich (although a very nice side effectü§û) - its about empowering the individual, seperation of state and money, and holding wealth for generations which allows us to think long term as a species. This allows us the freedom to build bigger and better and to explore further. Right now we spend all our money as quick as we can because we know its going to be worth less later on. Time to flip the script! "ooooh Lord pass me some more!" </small>
