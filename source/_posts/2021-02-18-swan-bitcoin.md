[![Swan Bitcoin](/assets/img/posts/swanbitcoin.jpg "Swan Bitcoin")](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)

Swan bitcoin is one of the best new ways to buy bitcoin by dollar cost averaging (DCA). Dollar cost averaging is an investment strategy for buying a certain amount periodically (daily, weekly or monthly). This allows the investor to not have to worry about "timing" the market. What's cool about Swan Bitcoin is that you can choose to have the bitcoin sent directly to your own wallet without having to store it with them! This is the Bitcoin way! More on wallets soon, but for now [check out a ton of great options here](https://bitcoin-only.com/wallets).
