Jack Mallers and Strike mean business. They just won the battle, permanently, for buying bitcoin with the cheapest fees. If you havent tried Strike, go download it! It's a tad strange for bitcoin veterans since the balance is always in dollars, but rest assuered that you can send your money out to a lighting (or on-chain) address at any time. Get ready world, here comes the reign of bitcoin companies!
