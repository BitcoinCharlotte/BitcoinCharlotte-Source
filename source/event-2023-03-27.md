# Workshop - Privacy, Non-KYC Bitcoin and Coin Control

##### Difference btw Privacy and Security?
- Privacy is keeping 3rd parties from knowing how much money you have or what you are doing with it. (Looking at Blockchain wonâ€™t help the 3rd party)
- Security is keeping people from stealing your money.

##### Is it possible to turn my KYC bitcoin into non-KYC bitcoin? If so, how?
- If you buy from an exchange they will always know you bought from them and the state / gov they are required to report to know about the purchase too.
- The only way you could potentially offset that is if you sold the exact same UTXO (bitcoin) back to them.
- Therefore - it's always best to purchase non-KYC (See options below)

##### Mixing
- Conjoins
  - turns multiple bitcoin transactions from multiple senders into a single transaction.
  - makes it difficult for thrid parties to determine which sender paid which recipient.
  - are non-custodial, you never send your coins anywhere else.

##### Services
- Sparrow Wallet / Mixing
  - How much am I going to spend at one time - thatâ€™s the denomination you should choose when mixing.
  - Larger amounts are harder to mix.
- Samourai [https://samouraiwallet.com/](https://samouraiwallet.com/)
- Wasabi (paying a coin surveillance company to keep out bad actors :/)
- Joinmarket [https://joinmarket.net](https://joinmarket.net) (run your own pool for mixing transaction for a small reward)

##### I have non-KYC btc, how can ensure my privacy when sending?
- Coin Control / UTXO
  - UTXO is an unspent transaction ready to be sent.
  - Each UTXO has its own history
  - Don't combine back into the same pile of coins

##### When sending "on-chain -> lightning -> etc -> lightning -> on-chain" does that improve privacy?
- It can, but its tricky
  - If you have your own node and run through "pools" its possible
- Otherwise
  - The lightning nodes routing your payments will know transaction info
