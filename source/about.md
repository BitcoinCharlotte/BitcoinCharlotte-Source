# About Bitcoin Charlotte 

We host socials and educational events for the Charlotte community to learn about Bitcoin. Our intention is to connect in person for networking, education and fun. These gatherings are truly invaluable experiences where long term friendships, life changing ideas, and business ventures are developed. 

<i>Interested in having your company, product or service highlighted in our social media, newsletter, and at our events? <a href="mailto:jacob@bitcoincharlotte.org?subject=Bitcoin Charlotte Sponsorship">Send us a message</a>! </i>
