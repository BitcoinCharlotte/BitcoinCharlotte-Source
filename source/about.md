# About Bitcoin Charlotte 

Bitcoin Charlotte is a local bitcoin community created in 2013 in Charlotte, North Carolina. We host socials and educational events to learn about Bitcoin and have some fun while doing it! We hope to liberate individuals and companies from financial dependency on traditional banks and governments by assisting them in using a better form of money, Bitcoin.
