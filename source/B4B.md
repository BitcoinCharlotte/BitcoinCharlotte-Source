# Bitcoin for Businesses

Our first event ["Bitcoin for Businesses"](/event-2022-03-23) was held on March 23rd, 2022. We will be updating this page with that presentation along with information specifically for local businesses. 

We will also be updating this page with all local businesses that accept Bitcoin in Charlotte. Come back soon to see all the bitcoin businesses in Charlotte! 

If you are a business interested in accepting Bitcoin, find us on [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/GRK-_ZZ8Qz7U34nB) or email us at [hodl@bitcoincharlotte.org](mailto:hodl@bitcoincharlotte.org) with any questions.
